# Scorekeeper

An easy to use score keeping application built with React using the Context API.

## Motivation

Everyone loves to play games with their friends and family but avoid pencil and paper scorekeeping and the inevitable math
errors that come along with it and use the Scorekeeper app instead.

* Customize player names
* Increase or decrease scores with a click of a button
* Highest scoring player is indicated with a crown icon
* Stats section displays total number of players and total score
* Includes a timer that can be paused and reset

## Future Improvements

* Deploy application on hosting site
* Add button to increase score in larger increments
* Add additional stylings

## To Run

* Download project files by running ```git clone https://github.com/LeeVaughn/scorekeeper/tree/context_api```
* Navigate to the project folder
* Install project dependencies with ```npm install```
* Type ```npm start``` to run application
* The application runs on localhost:3000, a new browser tab will open automatically

## About Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
